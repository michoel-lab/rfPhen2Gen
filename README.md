# rfPhen2Gen: A machine learning based association study of brain imaging phenotypes to genotypes

This repository contains code to reproduce figure for our paper titled [**rfPhen2Gen: A machine learning based association study of brain imaging phenotypes to genotypes**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00067).

* `Results_21Feb2022.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook to reproduce figures in the paper.
* `main_code.py` is a file that can be used to generate the `.npz` file needed for the above notebook
* `top1000SNP_feats.csv` contains feature importances obtained using Random Forest Regression for top 1000 SNPs.

**Note:** The data used in the study cannot be made public as we don't have the permissions to do so. The data can be accessed from the [Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) website.
